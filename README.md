## What is RAG?

In today’s world, we’re drowning in information. From customer support queries to academic research, the sheer volume of data makes it challenging to find relevant answers quickly. Traditional language models, while powerful, often struggle to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses, especially when the required information isn’t part of their training data.

Enter **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, a cutting-edge approach that combines the strengths of language models with document retrieval techniques. RAG systems enable AI to fetch relevant information from external sources and generate precise, context-aware responses

## Key components of RAG

### 1. **Retriever**

The retriever identifies and fetches the most relevant documents or data based on the user’s query. It can use:

- **Sparse Retrieval Models**: TF-IDF, BM25.
- **Dense Retrieval Models**: DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval), embeddings from models like Sentence-BERT or OpenAI Embeddings.

### 2. **Knowledge Base**

The knowledge base is the source of truth, containing structured or unstructured data for retrieval. Examples include:

- **Structured Data**: Databases, knowledge graphs.
- **Unstructured Data**: Text files, PDFs, websites, or any textual content.

### 3. **Generator**

The generator is a generative AI model (e.g., GPT-4) that uses the retrieved information to create coherent and contextually relevant responses.
