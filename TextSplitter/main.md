Chunking strategy in RAG applications is often overlooked.

Advanced chunking techniques ensure that the chunks are contextually coherent, enhancing the overall efficiency and accuracy of the system.

Semantically meaningful chunks lead to more effective embeddings.

LangChain offers some advanced chunking systems, we’re building our own LLM-based chunking system on top of LangChain’s TextSplitter abstract class. (Note: cost considerations are important!)

Let’s create a custom chunking strategy tailored for your use case.
